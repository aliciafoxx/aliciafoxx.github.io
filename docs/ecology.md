# Fundamental Ecology

I conduct research on how plant traits influence plant-plant and how plant-microbe interactions of seeds and the soil affect plant traits and interactions

Works include:

[Species variability in the relative strength of intraspecific and interspecific interactions](https://intapi.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/foecol-2022-0019)

[Plasticity in response to soil texture affects the relationships between a shoot and root trait and responses vary by population](https://intapi.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/foecol-2021-0020)

[Induced plasticity alters responses to conspecific interactions in seedlings of a perennial grass](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93494-0)

[Root and shoot competition lead to contrasting competitive outcomes under water stress: A systematic review and meta-analysis](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0220674)
