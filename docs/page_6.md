### Free and low-cost journals in ecology and evolution+

I put together a non-exhaustive list of free and low-cost journals in ecology and evolution+ [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zlE6GL-kA6UxNKyDQPtcSuwyi8-TuDXM/edit#gid=1938357888). Some journals don't make this information easy to find

Here is a paper [here](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/mSystems.01151-21) with SI on free journals in microbiome research that also provide fee waivers for scientists from low- and middle-income countries.

Please email me if you'd like to provide an addition at afoxx[@]chicagobotanic.org
