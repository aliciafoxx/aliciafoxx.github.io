# The Foxx Disrupting Ecology Lab

My name is Alicia Foxx and I work to make science better and how I can give back to my community through my work.

I'm a Conservation Scientist at the [Chicago Botanic Garden](https://www.chicagobotanic.org/research) and Assistant adjunct professor at Northwestern University in the [Plant Biology and Conservation Graduate Program](https://plantbiology.northwestern.edu/). I work to understand fundamental and applied ecology topics using experimental studies, and synthesis and data science. I also interrogate methods and best practices, ultimately to improve equity, inclusion, and reproducibility in research.
