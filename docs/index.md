# Research

I am a research scientist at the [Chicago Botanic Garden](https://www.chicagobotanic.org/) and I use syntheses, data science, and experimental studies to understand ecology and explore and equity and inclusion issues in science.

I conduct research on plant interactions and I work to understand how plant population variation influences interactions and species coexistence. My current work includes projects through the NSF BII New Roots For Restoration understanding interaction dynamics of native prairie plants.

Research to inform restoration

Iâ€™m working hard on synthesis projects and engaging in more metascience research to ask and answer how we can improve scientific outcomes starting with methods.

Inclusion in science

My work is moving into the intersection of ecology and data science
