I also research biocultural restoration in tallgrass restorations, BIPOC restoration practices in the US. I also explore how trait variation varies in population sources of restoration materials and how that affects function and interactions.</p> <p></p> <p>Our team created the Black Earth Restoration Collective (BERC) and launced in 2024. BERC is a collective of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) working closely with plants. We intend to cultivate this collective to center BIPOC perspectives, and to be a place for members to engage, discuss, support, and collaborate on topics in restoration and related topics (agriculture, plant-related research, sustainability, and ways these areas affect BIPOC communities). Please see the BERC website with more information and how to join.</p> <p></p> <p>I am also a part of the New Roots for Restoration (NSF Biological Integration Institute) - a cross disciplinary team across nine institutions with the aim of adding to the knowledge of perennial agriculture and native plant selection by understanding how root and shoot traits are interrelated and how the soil biotic and edaphic properties influence these relationships.
