
I use experimental and meta-analyses to address the conservation of culturally significant plants in urban environments such as agriculture, and urban restoration. I also research biocultural restoration, BIPOC restoration practices, and trait variation in population sources.

Our team created the Black Earth Restoration Collective (BERC) and launced in 2024. BERC is a collective of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) working closely with plants. We intend to cultivate this collective to center BIPOC perspectives, and to be a place for members to engage, discuss, support, and collaborate on topics in restoration and related topics (agriculture, plant-related research, sustainability, and ways these areas affect BIPOC communities). Please see the [BERC website](https://aliciafoxx.github.io/berc/about.html) with more information and how to join.
