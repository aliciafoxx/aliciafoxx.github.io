# The Foxx Disrupting Ecology Lab

I am a research scientist working to understand basic and applied ecology topics using experimental studies, synthesis and data science. I interrogate methods and best practices, ultimately to improve equity and inclusion issues in science and restoration practice.

I conduct research on how plant traits influence plant-plant and plant-microbe interactions, including how traits are distributed within and between plant populations. My current work aslo includes applied ecology projects that inform restoration practices in tallgrass and dryland ecosystems.
